##Imaging and Data Visualisation
In this module we will be looking at photography, illustration and using diagrams as a way of communication. We will look at both paper and screen-based approaches to creating images. I hope to learn more about how imagery can be used in an array of different design contexts and improve upon my photography and drawing skills. I would also like to develop more knowledge of the technical terms surrounding images such as vector, raster, resolution, compression, and bokeh. 

##Week 01 - *The Impact of Photography*
In Friday's lecture we looked at the usefulness of imagery within our work and how photography can be a fundemental part of a project. Having the ability to take your own photographs properly and use them within your work can be a massive benefit and allows you as a designer to provide more resources to future clients. 

*The Rule of Thirds*
The 'Rule of Thirds' is one of the most well known principles of photography. The 'Rule of Thirds' allows for well balanced and interesting shots. The main idea behind the rule of thirds is to think about breaking an image down into three parts, both horizontally and vertically, so that you have 9 equal parts. The four points created by the overlapping of these lines can help to idendify the most important parts of a photograph.
