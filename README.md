##Imaging and Data Visualisation
In this module we will be looking at photography, illustration and using diagrams as a way of communication. We will look at both paper and screen-based approaches to creating images. 

I hope to learn more about how imagery can be used in an array of different design contexts and improve upon my photography and drawing skills. I would also like to develop more knowledge of the technical terms surrounding images such as vector, raster, resolution, compression, and bokeh. 

##Week 1 - *The Impact of Photography*
In Friday's lecture we looked at the usefulness of imagery within our work and how photography can be a fundemental part of a project. Having the ability to take your own photographs properly and use them within your work can be a massive benefit and allows you as a designer to provide more resources to future clients. 

#####The Rule of Thirds
The *'Rule of Thirds'* is one of the most well known principles of photography it allows for well balanced and interesting shots. The main idea behind the rule of thirds is to think about breaking an image down into three parts, both horizontally and vertically, so that you have 9 equal parts. The four points created by the overlapping of these lines can help to idendify the most important parts of a photograph. 

Many studies have been carried out to show that when viewing images people's line of vision will usually focus initially on one of the intersection points rather than the centre of the photo. Using the rule of thirds therefore works well with the natural way of viewing an image rather than going against it.

The example above shows that the point of interest *the dog* is within the second and third intersections of the grid. This allows the photo to become a lot more balanced and enables the viewer to see it in a more natural light. The eyes and nose also fall between the interections which are a natural point of focus for a photo of an animal or person. 

#####Horizontal Lines in Photography
Horizontal lines are the basis of every composition and even images with no straight lines in them are bound by the horizontal or vertical frame that theyâ€™re contained in. Using horizontal lines within photos is a good way of grouping together different components and helps to show details within an image. In the photos I took below you can see that keeping the lines of the horizon completly horizontal really helps to add impact to the image and overall feel of the image whereas the other image doesn't give the same visual impact.

#####Angles in Photography
Adding different angles to photograpghs can really help to alter a photo's composition by just changing the perspective. In the photographs I took below you can see that altering your camera angles can really help to create a dramatic effect and make the subject a lot more interesting.

#####Filling your Frame
Using the technique of filling the frame of your photograph with the main subject can really help to create a more creative shot.  Below I got really close to this GATEPOST and filled the frame of the photo with it which I feel made the photo a lot more interesting and thoughtful.

#####Project Time!
We were also given a photography project to take a series of different shots of a piece archietecture whilst taking into consideration some of the techniques mentioned previously. The task includes choosing six of the best *Macro* shots and six of the best *Micro* shots. The photos I take will be uploaded to my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/127785088@N07/) in week 3.
